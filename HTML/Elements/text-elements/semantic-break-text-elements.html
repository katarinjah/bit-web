<p> It should be called The America Hates Inventors Act. The problem for inventors is that Congress and the Biden administration are dealing with a floundering economy. That puts pressure on them to do something — and <em>innovators</em> are a minority that politicians enjoy attacking. Unfortunately, while Congress can brag about changes to the patent system, <blockquote cite="https://uspolicy.org/sauer-patrick-leahys-war-on-innovation/"> the effects of running over inventor rights will not show up in the economy for several elections after the changes are made. That means legislators can make changes now, even if they might tank our nations economy in the future, and never pay the price.</blockquote> Leahy’s bill would create more patent challenges, encourage multiple avenues of challenges, expand what the PTAB examines in patent challenges, and make this kangaroo court available to government agencies. The Leahy bill is objectively bad for a country that prides itself on innovation. But Leahy is retiring, and now, there is talk about adding this bad bill to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is a must-pass bill that Congress will consider very soon.</p>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <p> PTAB was created by the America Invents Act to be a cheaper and faster patent court, but because of a lack of rules and clear procedures, it has been panned by everyone except patent infringers since then. <br>In one case, when the board didn’t rule in favor of the infringer, the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office added other board members. When, again, the vote didn’t go her way, she added another member. Eventually the inventor’s patent was taken away.</p>
